            <h1>Dlightful Web Redesign Case Study</h1>
            <img class="image" src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x250">
            <p>Dlightful stories is a group of videographers and photographers
               that creates content primarily for digital use such as facebook
               cover video, video content for youtube, etc.</p>
            <p>There’s an existing website but it was
               made as a temporary home page…</p>
            <h2>Understanding The Problem</h2>
            <p>We initially focused too much on the website and made assumptions on what
               our potential clients wanted to see like showing portfolios.
               During these discussions, we started talking about more broader questions like where do we want the business to go?
               What kind of projects and clients do we want?
               What is the purpose of this website? How do we know if the website is successful?</p>
            <p>We started to understand our previous projects and clients
               Using Journey Map of our previous clients
               Create Personas to understand them more</p>
            <p>Realization of where we wanted to go: Go to more brand videography so we can offer
               more types of video content and have more multi project deals with brands</p>
            <h2>Using Design Sprint Methodology</h2>
            <p>We realized our bigger questions can be answered using a Design Sprint
               *Short description of Design Sprint</p>
            <h2>New Project Goal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly define our value/offer in a more specific way.</li>
                <li>Define our ideal clients.</li>
                <li>How to use the website to connect our offer to clients.</li>
              </ul>
